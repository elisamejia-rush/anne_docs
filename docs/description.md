# What is the Anne&#174?

The Anne&#174 is a system of synced devices created by [Sibel Health, Inc](https://sibelhealth.com/). This system is comprised of two independent wearable devices, which are adhered to the chest and a finger, respectively.  

The chest device ([Anne&#174 Chest Sensor](https://sibelhealth.com/anne-chest/)) is a clinical-grade monitoring device that measures the electrical activity of the heart, also known as the electrocardiogram (ECG); the skin temperature; and motion activity using a triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope. From this data, it is possible to extract cardiovascular, temperature and movement features.

The device located on the finger ([Anne&#174 Limb Sensor](https://sibelhealth.com/anne-limb/)) is also a clinical-grade monitoring device which measures photoplethysmography (PPG), an optically-derived signal which varies with blood volume changes, and skin temperature. It is possible to obtain valuable temperature features and cardiovascular information, such as pulse rate and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), from this device.

Both devices feature battery life above 36 hours, which make them ideal for longer term monitoring without compromising signal quality. Moreover, they are internally synchronized, which implies that time-based metrics that require signals to be acquired precisely at the same instant can be reliably extracted from this system.

In addition to the devices, [Sibel Health, Inc](https://sibelhealth.com/) provides a mobile application that can be used to configure, monitor and download data from both chest and limb sensors. This application, called [DiscoveryRA](https://sibelhealth.com/clinical-trials-and-research/) can be used with any compatible iOS device and provides several functions to interact with the devices, including checking their battery; connecting different sensors; streaming data; and starting and stopping recordings.
