# Anne&#174 reference manual

This reference manual was created as part of the documentation for the Anne&#174 system used in the population studies from the [Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center (RADC)](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/research-rush-university/departmental-research/rush-alzheimers-disease-center) from [Rush University](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/).

## What is the RADC? 
The Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center is one of the 33 Alzheimer’s centers in the United States designated and funded by the National Institute on Aging.

Investigators at the RADC focus on four main areas of research, including risk factors, neurological basis of the disease and improving diagnosis and treatment. For more than 35 years, researchers at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center have studied how to both treat and prevent dementia. 

Experts at the RADC understand the physical and emotional toll the disease takes on patients and their families. They’re committed to discovering better ways to diagnose, treat and prevent Alzheimer’s and other dementias.

The Center also offers patient care services at the RUSH Memory Clinic, including neurological and psychological evaluations and consultation with Alzheimer’s specialists.

## What do we do at the Device team from the RADC?
At the Device team from the RADC, we manage hardware and software for device pipelines used in various studies at the RADC. These devices include the Anne&#174 system, but it also include other devices used to measure gait, activity, and other behaviors. 

We also perform quality control of the data we acquire, as well as extract features and analyse the obtained data. Finally, we make sure the devices and data we are using are reliable and useful for better understanding Alzheimer's disease, dementia and ageing.
